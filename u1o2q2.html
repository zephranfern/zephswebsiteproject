        <h3> 2. Were the tools I used the appropriate tools for the project? </h3>
        <p>I believe they were appropriate enough for the brief I was given. 
            However if I knew more about HTML and CSS my website could have been better. 
            Also I could have used PHP but I didnâ€™t have the knowledge to use it. 
            I could also have used Wordpress. 
            I think trello was probably the best option when it can to planing as it was significantly quicker to set up than using pen and paper. 
            Using GitHub to upload and store my content was a good choice as it not only stored my project but allowed other designers to look at and assist with the building of the project with advice.</p>

        <h1> About me </h1>
        <h3> Who am I? </h3>
        <p> My name is Zephran Lucas Orion Fern, though most people just call me Zeph. I’m 20 years old and I‘m half American, half Scottish. 
        While I'm a programmer at heart, my ultimate goal is to create music for video games. However knowing me when i reach that goal I'll probably have another! </p>
        <h3> Why I code </h3>
        <p> I didn't always want to be a programmer. When I was younger, I wanted to be a pilot but due to my eye condition that was impossible. 
        So after realising this I went through the motions of school trying to find out what I wanted to do with my life. One night while I was playing video games I had a thought.
        Instead of just playing games why don't I try creating them? So the day after a tried my first crack at code using scratch and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
        I went onto study BTEC Media in high school and I haven't regretted my choice one bit. </p>
        <h3> How I learned how to code </h3> 
        <p> I studied a computer science course in college and went onto study in a Games Design course in University. 
        After discovering that the course was to much art for my liking and that I wasn’t enjoying myself, I decided to withdraw and look for work. </p>
        <h3> So why Codenation? </h3>
        <p> Due to my lack of workplace experience I found it difficult to find work. That’s when my work coach told me about Codenation. 
        After doing some research into it, finding out what it was and what I would gain from it, I decided to sign up. 
        I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the experience so far and plan to continue learning more about code and technology even after I complete this course and hopefully gotten a job or apprenticeship. </p>

    <h3 class="margin"> How would you go about selecting which tools to use for the job? </h3>
    <p class="margin">Which tools you use really depends on the job you undertake. It’s important to go over the brief and truly understand what it is the customer is asking for. 
        Once you know that you need to make a plan. Using Trello is a good way to make a plan. It’s important to outline the details of the project before hand as it saves hours of work down the line. 
        Once you have your plan you need to choose which tool to use in order to create it. For creating websites it’s a good idea to use HTML and CSS. For more technical projects, javascript is another tool you can use. 
        Both of these languages can be used in Visual Studio Code. But its important to note that there are many more languages you can use so do some research to find out which tool is best suited to complete the brief.</p>

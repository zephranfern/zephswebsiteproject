    <h3 class="margin"> What methods and skills do you need to complete projects successfully. What tools would you need? </h3>
    <p class="margin">When it comes to the tools you’ll need it really depends on the project but In most cases you’ll more than likely need HTML and CSS and the knowledge on how to use them as these are the two languages of the internet. 
        Another useful language to know is javascript as HTML and CSS are mainly website creation and presentation while javascript is more of a problem solving script. 
        One of the most important skills to have is a problem solving mindset as when it comes to working on code you’re bound to come across several problems. 
        Another important skill is to pay attention to detail as often it’s the smallest little oversize that can cause an error in the code. 
        The ability to adapt is quite crucial as well as when a certain method of coding just isn’t working then you need to change your approach to the problem to adapt and overcome it.</p>

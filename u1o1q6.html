        <h3> How have my chosen technologies helped me with my project. </h3>
        <p>Trello has provided me with a simple way of planning and executing each little detail of my project. 
        It also provided a place for me to store all my coding errors for me to categorise and fix accordingly. 
        I used Git hub as a way to save my work and upload my project to the internet. It also provided some good advise as others could look at my code and provide advise on how to fix and improve my project. 
        And finally thereâ€™s Visual Studio Code, I found this tools simple to use once you understand it and it made my project look more visually appealing as well.</p>

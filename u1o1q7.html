        <h3> What legal guidelines and constraints must we abide by. </h3>
        <p>There are some laws you have to abide by when uploading digital projects and this can restrict what you include in your projects. 
        One of these regulations is General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR requires that website must obtain the users permission to store any data while using their site such as “cookies”. 
        Also if personal data stored on the site becomes breached then the website must inform the user. Another law we have to abide by is copyright. 
        Copyright protects a persons content so if another person posts the same thing under their name they would get penalised for it. 
        That’s why it’s always important to have a link to the original information source and have the creators permission to use it on your site.</p>

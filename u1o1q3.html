    <p class="margin">One of the best ways to plan out digital tasks is to use trello.com. 
        Trello is an online checklist of sorts. You can create multiple lists and create cards with different objectives for each one and move these cards from list to list. 
        Itâ€™s always a good a idea to have a to do, a doing and a done list so you can set up your objectives before getting started on the project. 
        You can also create other lists so you can separate the important objectives from the lesser important ones.</p>

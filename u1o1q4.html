        <h3> What risks might you encounter while working on digital projects? </h3>
        <p>One of, if not the biggest risk with digital technology is cyber security. A data breach, whether it be personal data or company data it can cause massive problems. 
        People using their personal devices on company networks not only endanger the users privacy but it also lowers the security of the companies network if their security isn’t up to date. 
        If a section of the system goes down then business can grind to a halt. Another risk is updating a section of code that runs but isn’t correct as code like this, while fine short term can cause massive problems in the future.</p>
